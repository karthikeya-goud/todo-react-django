TODO using React + Django
---------------------------

I wanna do CRUD operations and create api's and thought connect to the react application , so i selected a todo application

So for todo, model i took is (title,description,deadline:date,completed:boolean)


First i started with the setting up the project structure

created a folder name todo-react-django
 in that created 2 folders backend,frontend
 in backend , created a python virtual environment
 same for the frontend ,created a react application with typescript template


I started with backend 
    wrote model code,attached to admin panel
    wrote FBV's for the CRUD operations
    i tested the api end points manully using postman

    then got an idea to write testcases
    took help from chatgpt , understood how to write testcases
    so wriiten some test cases for the api's
    exceuted the test cases 


In frontend
    decided to do a basic UI
    created a simple layout 
    using axios, called the endpoints



what i learnt from this
------------------------
- CRUD operations
- Connecting to React
- understood some git commands while doing project


what we can do more
-------------------
- Giving filtering options
- optimizing some redudant code
- field level checking in frontend and backend
- updating error handling and showing codes and messages in Toast
- making ui responsive
